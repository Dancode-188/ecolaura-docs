# 🌿 Ecolaura Database Schema: Nurturing Our Data Ecosystem



Welcome to Ecolaura's Database Schema documentation! Just as a thriving ecosystem relies on interconnected elements, our database schema forms the foundation of our sustainable e-commerce platform. Let's dive into the rich soil of our data structure! 🌱💾



## 🌍 Overview



Ecolaura's database is designed to support our mission of sustainable e-commerce. We use PostgreSQL, a robust and eco-friendly (low energy consumption) relational database management system.



## 🌳 Table Structure



Our database is like a lush forest, with each table representing a different species of tree. Let's explore our data forest!



### 1. 👤 Users



The mighty oak of our ecosystem, supporting all user-related data.



```sql

CREATE TABLE users (

  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),

  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,

  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

  first_name VARCHAR(100),

  last_name VARCHAR(100),

  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

);



CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

```



### 2. 🛍️ Products



The versatile bamboo, flexible and essential for our e-commerce operations.



```sql

CREATE TABLE products (

  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),

  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

  description TEXT,

  price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,

  sustainability_score INT CHECK (sustainability_score >= 0 AND sustainability_score <= 100),

  stock_quantity INT NOT NULL,

  category VARCHAR(100),

  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

);



CREATE INDEX idx_products_category ON products(category);

CREATE INDEX idx_products_sustainability_score ON products(sustainability_score);

```



### 3. 🛒 Orders



The sturdy pine, tracking the journey of our sustainable products.



```sql

CREATE TABLE orders (

  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),

  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),

  total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,

  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

);



CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON orders(status);

```



### 4. 🌿 Order_Items



The leaves of our pine tree, detailing each item in an order.



```sql

CREATE TABLE order_items (

  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),

  order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(id),

  product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),

  quantity INT NOT NULL,

  price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL

);



CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_order_id ON order_items(order_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_product_id ON order_items(product_id);

```



### 5. 🏆 Gamification



The playful willow tree, adding fun and engagement to our ecosystem.



```sql

CREATE TABLE gamification (

  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),

  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),

  green_points INT DEFAULT 0,

  level INT DEFAULT 1,

  badges JSONB,

  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

);



CREATE INDEX idx_gamification_user_id ON gamification(user_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_gamification_green_points ON gamification(green_points);

```



### 6. 🔄 Trade_Ins



The resourceful mangrove, managing our circular economy initiatives.



```sql

CREATE TABLE trade_ins (

  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),

  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),

  product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),

  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

  estimated_credit DECIMAL(10, 2),

  actual_credit DECIMAL(10, 2),

  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

);



CREATE INDEX idx_trade_ins_user_id ON trade_ins(user_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_trade_ins_status ON trade_ins(status);

```



## 🌿 Relationships



Our tables are interconnected like a mycelial network in a thriving forest:



- Users have many Orders (one-to-many)

- Orders have many Order_Items (one-to-many)

- Products appear in many Order_Items (one-to-many)

- Users have one Gamification profile (one-to-one)

- Users can have many Trade_Ins (one-to-many)



## 🌱 Data Types and Constraints



We've carefully chosen our data types and constraints to ensure our database remains as pure as untouched nature:



- UUIDs for primary keys: Ensures uniqueness across distributed systems

- TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE: Keeps our data temporally aware, like a sundial

- DECIMAL for financial data: Maintains precision in calculations

- CHECK constraints: Keeps our data within ecological limits (e.g., sustainability_score)

- JSONB for flexible data: Allows for organic growth in areas like badges



## 🌴 Indexing Strategy



Our indexes are like well-placed bird feeders, attracting queries to the right spots:



- Email for quick user lookups

- Category and sustainability score for efficient product filtering

- User IDs in related tables for speedy joins

- Status fields for quick filtering of orders and trade-ins



## 🍃 Normalization Approach



We've normalized our data structure to the Third Normal Form (3NF), striking a balance between data integrity and query performance. This approach:



- Reduces data redundancy

- Minimizes data anomalies

- Ensures each piece of data has a home, like every animal in its proper habitat



## 🌊 Handling Specific Data Requirements



- Sustainability Scores: Stored as integers for efficient indexing and range queries

- Gamification Data: Uses JSONB for flexible badge storage, allowing for easy addition of new achievements

- Trade-In Status: Uses a VARCHAR with predefined values to track the trade-in lifecycle



## 💡 Best Practices for Database Interaction



1. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

2. Implement database transactions for operations that modify multiple tables

3. Use appropriate indexes for frequently accessed data

4. Regularly analyze and optimize query performance

5. Implement proper error handling and logging for database operations



## 🔮 Future Considerations



As our forest grows, we may need to adapt:



1. Implement table partitioning for high-volume tables like orders

2. Consider using materialized views for complex, frequently-accessed data

3. Explore PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities for product searches

4. Implement a caching layer (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed, rarely changed data

5. Plan for potential sharding strategies as data volume grows



Remember, a well-designed database schema is like a balanced ecosystem – it supports growth, adapts to change, and provides a stable foundation for all life (or in our case, features) that depend on it. Happy querying, eco-warriors! 🌿🐘💚
