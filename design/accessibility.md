# ♿ Ecolaura Accessibility: Cultivating an Inclusive Digital Ecosystem



Welcome to Ecolaura's Accessibility guide! Just as a thriving ecosystem is diverse and accessible to all its inhabitants, our platform aims to be usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. Let's explore how we're making our digital forest welcoming to all! 🌿👥



## 🌍 Overview



At Ecolaura, we believe that sustainability and accessibility go hand in hand. Our commitment to accessibility ensures that:



- All users can easily navigate and use our platform

- We comply with legal requirements and industry standards

- We extend our ethos of inclusivity to the digital realm



## 🏆 WCAG Compliance



We strive to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA compliance. This means our site aims to be:



1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

2. **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.

3. **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.

4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.



## 🎨 Color and Contrast



We ensure our color choices don't create barriers:



- Maintain a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text

- Don't rely on color alone to convey information



Example of a color contrast check function:



```javascript

function checkContrast(foreground, background) {

 const luminance1 = getLuminance(foreground);

 const luminance2 = getLuminance(background);

 const ratio = (Math.max(luminance1, luminance2) + 0.05) / 

        (Math.min(luminance1, luminance2) + 0.05);

 return ratio >= 4.5 ? 'Pass' : 'Fail';

}



function getLuminance(hex) {

 const rgb = parseInt(hex.slice(1), 16);

 const r = (rgb >> 16) & 0xff;

 const g = (rgb >> 8) & 0xff;

 const b = (rgb >> 0) & 0xff;

 const luminance = 0.2126 * r + 0.7152 * g + 0.0722 * b;

 return luminance / 255;

}

```



## ⌨️ Keyboard Navigation



We ensure all functionality is accessible via keyboard:



- All interactive elements are focusable and operable with a keyboard

- Focus order follows a logical sequence

- Focus styles are clearly visible



Example of ensuring focusable elements:



```css

/* Ensure all interactive elements have a focus style */

a:focus,

button:focus,

input:focus,

select:focus,

textarea:focus {

 outline: 2px solid #4CAF50; /* Eco Green */

 outline-offset: 2px;

}



/* Hide focus styles when using mouse */

:focus:not(:focus-visible) {

 outline: none;

}

```



## 🔊 Screen Reader Compatibility



We optimize our content for screen readers:



- Use semantic HTML to convey structure and meaning

- Provide descriptive labels for form controls

- Use ARIA attributes when necessary



Example of a screen reader-friendly button:



```html

<button aria-label="Add Eco-Friendly Water Bottle to cart">

 <span aria-hidden="true">🛒</span> Add to Cart

</button>

```



## 📝 Form Design and Error Handling



Our forms are designed to be accessible and user-friendly:



- Clearly label all form controls

- Provide helpful error messages

- Allow users to easily understand and correct errors



Example of accessible form error handling:



```jsx

function FormField({ id, label, error }) {

 return (

  <div>

   <label htmlFor={id}>{label}</label>

   <input id={id} aria-describedby={`${id}-error`} />

   {error && <p id={`${id}-error`} role="alert">{error}</p>}

  </div>

 );

}

```



## 🖼️ Alternative Text for Images



We provide meaningful alternative text for images:



- Describe the content and function of the image

- Use empty alt attributes for decorative images



Example:



```html

<img src="eco-bottle.jpg" alt="Reusable stainless steel water bottle with bamboo cap">

```



## 🧪 Testing Accessibility



We regularly test our platform for accessibility:



- Use automated tools like axe-core for initial scans

- Conduct manual keyboard navigation tests

- Test with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver)

- Perform user testing with individuals who have disabilities



Example of integrating axe-core in tests:



```javascript

import { axe } from 'jest-axe';



test('Button is accessible', async () => {

 const { container } = render(<Button>Click me</Button>);

 const results = await axe(container);

 expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();

});

```



## 🚫 Common Issues to Avoid



- Low color contrast

- Missing alternative text for images

- Lack of keyboard accessibility

- Absence of form labels

- Inaccessible custom controls (e.g., custom dropdowns)



## 🌱 Accessibility and Sustainability



Our commitment to accessibility aligns with our sustainability mission:



- Inclusivity is a key aspect of social sustainability

- Accessible design often leads to cleaner, more efficient code

- By making our platform accessible, we expand our reach and impact



## 🌿 Nurturing an Accessible Ecosystem



Accessibility is an ongoing process:



- Regularly audit our platform for accessibility issues

- Stay updated on the latest accessibility guidelines and technologies

- Foster a culture of accessibility awareness among our team

- Gather feedback from users with disabilities to continually improve



By prioritizing accessibility, we ensure that Ecolaura is a platform where all users can flourish, regardless of their abilities. Together, we're cultivating a more inclusive and sustainable digital world! 🌱♿🌍
