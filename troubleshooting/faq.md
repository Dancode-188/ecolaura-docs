## 🛒 Shopping Experience

### Q: How does the Sustainability Score work?
A: Our Sustainability Score (1-100) is like a tree's rings – it tells a product's eco-story at a glance. We analyze various factors:

- 📦 Packaging (15%): Minimal? Recyclable?
- 🚚 Transportation (10%): Carbon footprint of shipping
- ♻️ End-of-Life (10%): Recyclability or compostability

A score of 80+ is outstanding, 60-79 is good, and we don't list anything below 50.
