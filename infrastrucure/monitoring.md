# 🔍 Ecolaura Monitoring: Keeping Our Digital Ecosystem Healthy



Welcome to Ecolaura's Monitoring documentation! Just as we keep a watchful eye on our planet's health, we maintain vigilant monitoring of our digital systems. Let's explore how we ensure our eco-friendly platform stays robust, responsive, and resilient! 🌿💻



## 🎯 Overview



Ecolaura's monitoring strategy is designed to provide real-time insights into the health, performance, and security of our systems. We employ a combination of tools and practices to ensure high availability, rapid incident response, and continuous improvement of our platform.



## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies



We use a suite of powerful tools to keep our digital forest thriving:



1. **Prometheus**: For metrics collection and storage

2. **Grafana**: For metrics visualization and dashboarding

3. **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): For log management and analysis

4. **AlertManager**: For alert routing, grouping, and notification

5. **Jaeger**: For distributed tracing

6. **Blackbox Exporter**: For endpoint probing and synthetic monitoring



## 📊 Key Metrics and Logs



### System Metrics

- CPU usage

- Memory utilization

- Disk I/O

- Network traffic



### Application Metrics

- Request rate

- Response times

- Error rates

- Active users

- Subscription sign-ups

- Order processing times



### Business Metrics

- Daily active users

- Revenue

- Subscription box fill rate

- Customer satisfaction score



### Logs

- Application logs

- Nginx access logs

- Database query logs

- Authentication logs



## ⚠️ Alert Configuration



We use a tiered alerting system to ensure the right people are notified at the right time:



1. **INFO**: Noteworthy but not critical. Logged for later analysis.

2. **WARNING**: Requires attention but not immediate action.

3. **ERROR**: Requires prompt action to prevent user impact.

4. **CRITICAL**: Severe issues requiring immediate attention.



Example Prometheus alerting rule:



```yaml

groups:

- name: example

 rules:

 - alert: HighRequestLatency

  expr: job:request_latency_seconds:mean5m{job="ecolaura-api"} > 0.5

  for: 10m

  labels:

   severity: warning

  annotations:

   summary: High request latency on {{ $labels.instance }}

   description: Request latency is above 500ms (current value: {{ $value }}s)

```



## 📈 Dashboards



We maintain a series of Grafana dashboards for different aspects of our system:



1. **System Overview**: High-level health of all systems

2. **API Performance**: Detailed metrics on API response times and error rates

3. **User Journey**: Tracks user flow through the application

4. **Business Metrics**: Displays key performance indicators

5. **Subscription Box Lifecycle**: Monitors the subscription box creation and delivery process



Example Grafana dashboard configuration:



```json

{

 "title": "API Performance",

 "panels": [

  {

   "title": "Request Rate",

   "type": "graph",

   "datasource": "Prometheus",

   "targets": [

    {

     "expr": "sum(rate(http_requests_total{job=\"ecolaura-api\"}[5m])) by (status_code)",

     "legendFormat": "{{status_code}}"

    }

   ]

  },

  {

   "title": "Response Time",

   "type": "heatmap",

   "datasource": "Prometheus",

   "targets": [

    {

     "expr": "sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{job=\"ecolaura-api\"}[5m])) by (le)"

    }

   ]

  }

 ]

}

```



## 🚨 Incident Response



When alerts are triggered, we follow a structured incident response process:



1. **Alert**: Relevant team members are notified based on the alert severity.

2. **Assess**: The on-call engineer evaluates the alert and determines the impact.

3. **Respond**: Immediate actions are taken to mitigate the issue.

4. **Resolve**: The root cause is addressed and normal operation is restored.

5. **Review**: A post-mortem is conducted to prevent future occurrences.



## 💡 Best Practices



1. **Instrument Everything**: Add custom metrics to all critical paths in your code.

2. **Use Labels**: Properly label metrics for easy filtering and aggregation.

3. **Set Meaningful Thresholds**: Base alert thresholds on historical data and business impact.

4. **Correlate Metrics and Logs**: Use tracing to connect metrics with relevant logs.

5. **Regular Review**: Continuously refine dashboards and alerts based on operational experiences.



## 🔧 Implementation Tips



Here's a simple Python example of how to instrument your code with Prometheus metrics:



```python

from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

from functools import wraps

import time



REQUEST_COUNT = Counter('request_count', 'App Request Count', ['method', 'endpoint', 'http_status'])

REQUEST_LATENCY = Histogram('request_latency_seconds', 'Request latency', ['endpoint'])



def monitor(endpoint):

  def decorator(f):

    @wraps(f)

    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):

      start_time = time.time()

      status = "500"

      try:

        result = f(*args, **kwargs)

        status = "200"

        return result

      finally:

        REQUEST_COUNT.labels(method='GET', endpoint=endpoint, http_status=status).inc()

        REQUEST_LATENCY.labels(endpoint=endpoint).observe(time.time() - start_time)

    return decorated_function

  return decorator


@monitor('/api/v1/products')

def get_products():

  # Your code here

  pass

```



## 🔮 Future Enhancements



We're always looking to improve our monitoring capabilities:



1. **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**: Implement machine learning models to identify unusual patterns.

2. **Automated Remediation**: Develop scripts to automatically resolve common issues.

3. **User Experience Monitoring**: Implement real user monitoring (RUM) for frontend performance tracking.

4. **Green Metrics**: Track and display the carbon footprint of our infrastructure.



## 🐛 Troubleshooting



- **False Positives**: Regularly review and adjust alert thresholds to minimize noise.

- **Alert Fatigue**: Implement alert grouping and smart notification routing to prevent overwhelming on-call staff.

- **Data Retention**: Balance data granularity with storage costs by implementing appropriate data retention policies.
