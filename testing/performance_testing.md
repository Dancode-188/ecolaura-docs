# 🚀 Ecolaura Performance Testing: Cultivating Speed and Efficiency



Welcome to Ecolaura's Performance Testing documentation! Just as a thriving ecosystem depends on efficient energy flow, our platform relies on optimal performance to serve our eco-conscious users. Let's explore how we ensure Ecolaura runs as smoothly as a well-balanced natural habitat! 🌿⚡



## 🎯 Overview



Ecolaura's performance testing strategy aims to:

1. Ensure the platform can handle expected user loads

2. Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks

3. Validate scalability of our architecture

4. Maintain fast response times for critical user journeys

5. Optimize resource utilization



## 🛠️ Tools We Use



We primarily use the following tools for performance testing:



1. **Locust**: For load testing and user behavior simulation

2. **New Relic**: For application performance monitoring

3. **pgbench**: For database performance testing

4. **Grafana** & **Prometheus**: For real-time monitoring during tests



## 📊 Key Performance Metrics



We focus on these critical metrics:



1. Response Time

2. Throughput (requests per second)

3. Error Rate

4. CPU Usage

5. Memory Usage

6. Database Query Execution Time

7. Network I/O



## 🌱 Setting Up Test Environments



We maintain dedicated performance testing environments that mirror production:



```yaml

# docker-compose.perf-test.yml

version: '3'

services:

 web:

  image: ecolaura/web:latest

  environment:

   - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=ecolaura.settings.performance

 db:

  image: postgres:13

  environment:

   - POSTGRES_DB=ecolaura_perf

 cache:

  image: redis:6

```



Ensure the performance environment uses production-like data volumes.



## 🏃‍♀️ Creating and Running Test Scenarios



We use Locust to simulate user behavior and load:



```python

# locustfile.py

from locust import HttpUser, task, between



class EcolauraUser(HttpUser):

  wait_time = between(1, 5)



  @task(3)

  def view_product(self):

    self.client.get("/api/v1/products/1/")



  @task(1)

  def add_to_cart(self):

    self.client.post("/api/v1/cart/add/", json={

      "product_id": 1,

      "quantity": 1

    })



  @task

  def checkout(self):

    self.client.post("/api/v1/orders/create/", json={

      "shipping_address": "123 Eco Street, Green City",

      "payment_method": "eco_pay"

    })

```



To run the test:



```bash

locust -f locustfile.py --host=https://perf-test.ecolaura.com

```



## 📈 Analyzing Test Results



After each test run, we analyze the results:



1. Review Locust's web interface for high-level metrics

2. Examine New Relic for detailed application performance data

3. Check Grafana dashboards for system-level metrics



Key questions to answer:

- Did we meet our performance SLAs?

- Where are the bottlenecks?

- How does performance degrade as load increases?



## 💡 Best Practices



1. **Realistic Data**: Use production-like data volumes and distributions

2. **Gradual Ramp-up**: Increase load gradually to identify breaking points

3. **Regular Testing**: Perform tests after significant changes and on a scheduled basis

4. **Varied Scenarios**: Test different user journeys and peak load situations

5. **Monitoring**: Always monitor resource utilization during tests



## 🔄 CI/CD Integration



We integrate performance tests into our CI/CD pipeline:



```yaml

# .github/workflows/performance.yml

name: Performance Tests

on:

 push:

  branches: [ main ]

jobs:

 performance-test:

  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  steps:

  - uses: actions/checkout@v2

  - name: Set up Python

   uses: actions/setup-python@v2

   with:

    python-version: '3.9'

  - name: Install dependencies

   run: |

    pip install locust

  - name: Run Locust tests

   run: |

    locust -f locustfile.py --host=https://perf-test.ecolaura.com --users 100 --spawn-rate 10 -t 5m --headless --only-summary

```



## 🚧 Common Bottlenecks and Solutions



1. **Slow Database Queries**

  - Solution: Optimize queries, add indexes, use caching



2. **High Server CPU Usage**

  - Solution: Profile code, optimize algorithms, consider scaling horizontally



3. **Memory Leaks**

  - Solution: Use memory profilers, fix leaks in application code



4. **Network Latency**

  - Solution: Use CDN, optimize payload size, implement HTTP/2



## 🔧 API and Database Optimization



### API Optimization:

- Implement pagination for list endpoints

- Use compression for response payloads

- Optimize serialization process



Example of paginated API:



```python

from rest_framework.pagination import PageNumberPagination

from rest_framework.viewsets import ModelViewSet



class StandardResultsSetPagination(PageNumberPagination):

  page_size = 100

  page_size_query_param = 'page_size'

  max_page_size = 1000



class ProductViewSet(ModelViewSet):

  queryset = Product.objects.all()

  serializer_class = ProductSerializer

  pagination_class = StandardResultsSetPagination

```



### Database Optimization:

- Use database connection pooling

- Implement query caching

- Regularly analyze and optimize slow queries



Example of query optimization:



```python

from django.db.models import Prefetch



def get_orders_with_items():

  return Order.objects.prefetch_related(

    Prefetch('items', queryset=OrderItem.objects.select_related('product'))

  )

```



## 🌱 Continuous Improvement



We continuously refine our performance testing approach:

1. Regularly review and update test scenarios

2. Keep testing tools and environments up-to-date

3. Share performance testing results and insights with the team

4. Conduct post-analysis sessions after major releases



## 🐛 Troubleshooting



1. **Inconsistent Results**: Ensure clean test environment and consistent data state

2. **False Positives**: Verify that monitoring tools aren't impacting performance

3. **Unrealistic Scenarios**: Regularly validate test scripts against real user behavior
