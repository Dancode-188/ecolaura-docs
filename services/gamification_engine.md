## 🛠️ Technical Implementation



Our Gamification Engine is built with scalability and flexibility in mind:



```python

from datetime import datetime



class GamificationEngine:

  def __init__(self, user_id):

    self.user_id = user_id

    self.user_data = self.load_user_data()



  def award_points(self, action, points):

    self.user_data['total_points'] += points

    self.user_data['actions'].append({

      'action': action,

      'points': points,

      'timestamp': datetime.now()

    })

    self.check_level_up()

    self.check_badges()

    self.save_user_data()



  def check_level_up(self):

    new_level = self.calculate_level(self.user_data['total_points'])

    if new_level > self.user_data['level']:

      self.user_data['level'] = new_level

      self.trigger_level_up_event()



  def check_badges(self):

    for badge in AVAILABLE_BADGES:

      if badge not in self.user_data['badges'] and self.qualify_for_badge(badge):

        self.award_badge(badge)



  def start_challenge(self, challenge_id):

    challenge = self.get_challenge(challenge_id)

    self.user_data['active_challenges'].append({

      'id': challenge_id,

      'start_time': datetime.now(),

      'progress': 0

    })



  def update_challenge_progress(self, challenge_id, progress):

    for challenge in self.user_data['active_challenges']:

      if challenge['id'] == challenge_id:

        challenge['progress'] = progress

        if progress >= 100:

          self.complete_challenge(challenge_id)



  def get_leaderboard(self, category):

    # Fetch and return leaderboard data

    pass



  # Helper methods

  def load_user_data(self):

    # Load user data from database

    pass



  def save_user_data(self):

    # Save user data to database

    pass



  def calculate_level(self, points):

    # Calculate user level based on points

    pass



  def qualify_for_badge(self, badge):

    # Check if user qualifies for a badge

    pass



  def award_badge(self, badge):

    # Award a badge to the user

    pass



  def get_challenge(self, challenge_id):

    # Fetch challenge details

    pass



  def complete_challenge(self, challenge_id):

    # Handle challenge completion

    pass



  def trigger_level_up_event(self):

    # Trigger events for level up (e.g., notifications)

    pass

```



## 🌐 API Endpoints



The Gamification Engine exposes RESTful API endpoints:

Example Test Case (Python with pytest):



```python

import pytest

from gamification_engine import GamificationEngine



def test_point_award_and_level_up():

  engine = GamificationEngine("test_user")

  initial_level = engine.user_data['level']

  engine.award_points("eco_purchase", 1000)

  assert engine.user_data['total_points'] == 1000

  assert engine.user_data['level'] > initial_level

  assert "Eco Enthusiast" in engine.user_data['badges']



def test_challenge_completion():

  engine = GamificationEngine("test_user")

  engine.start_challenge("plastic_free_week")

  engine.update_challenge_progress("plastic_free_week", 100)

  assert "plastic_free_week" not in [c['id'] for c in engine.user_data['active_challenges']]

  assert engine.user_data['total_points'] >= 50 # Minimum points for challenge completion

```



## 🌱 Future Growth



As our Gamification Engine evolves, we plan to:

1. Implement AR features for real-world eco-action verification

2. Develop a virtual eco-city that grows with user achievements

3. Create partnerships for real-world rewards (e.g., tree planting for points)

4. Implement AI-driven dynamic difficulty adjustment for challenges



By continually nurturing our Gamification Engine, we're cultivating a more engaged and motivated community of eco-warriors. Together, we're turning sustainable living into a rewarding, fun-filled adventure! 🌿🎮🌍
