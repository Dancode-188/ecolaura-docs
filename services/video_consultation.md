# 📹 Ecolaura Video Consultation: Nurturing Sustainable Connections



Welcome to Ecolaura's Video Consultation service documentation! Just as nature thrives on interconnectedness, our video consultation feature fosters direct connections between users and sustainability experts. Let's explore how we're cultivating face-to-face guidance in our digital eco-system! 🌿💻



## 🌍 Overview



The Video Consultation service is a vital branch of Ecolaura, offering:

- Real-time video interactions with sustainability experts

- Personalized advice on eco-friendly product choices

- In-depth discussions on sustainable living practices



Think of it as a digital treehouse where eco-conscious consumers can climb up for a chat with wise forest guardians.



## 🔗 Integration with Ecolaura



The Video Consultation service integrates seamlessly with the Ecolaura platform:

- Links directly from product pages and user dashboards

- Interfaces with the user profile system for personalized consultations

- Connects with the AI Consultant for pre- and post-consultation insights

- Feeds back into the recommendation engine to improve future suggestions



## 🌟 Key Features



1. **Real-time Video Streaming**: High-quality, low-latency video calls.

2. **Screen Sharing**: Ability to share product details or eco-tips visually.

3. **Scheduling System**: Flexible booking of consultation slots.

4. **Expert Matching**: Pairing users with the most suitable sustainability expert.

5. **Recording and Playback**: Option to record sessions for future reference (with consent).



## 🛠️ Technical Implementation



We use WebRTC for real-time communication, ensuring high-quality, peer-to-peer video streaming:



```javascript

// Client-side implementation using Simple-Peer

import Peer from 'simple-peer'



class VideoConsultation {

 constructor(stream, initiator) {

  this.peer = new Peer({

   initiator: initiator,

   stream: stream,

   trickle: false

  })



  this.peer.on('signal', data => {

   // Send signaling data to the other peer

   socket.emit('signal', data)

  })



  this.peer.on('stream', stream => {

   // Display the remote video stream

   const video = document.querySelector('video')

   video.srcObject = stream

   video.play()

  })

 }



 signal(data) {

  this.peer.signal(data)

 }

}



// Usage

navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })

 .then(stream => {

  const call = new VideoConsultation(stream, true)

  // Handle signaling...

 })

```



## 🌐 API Endpoints



The Video Consultation service exposes RESTful API endpoints:



1. `POST /api/v1/consultations`: Schedule a new consultation

2. `GET /api/v1/consultations/{id}`: Retrieve consultation details

3. `POST /api/v1/consultations/{id}/join`: Join a consultation session

4. `GET /api/v1/experts`: List available sustainability experts



Example API Request:

```http

POST /api/v1/consultations

Content-Type: application/json



{

 "user_id": "u-123456",

 "expert_id": "e-789012",

 "scheduled_time": "2023-09-15T14:30:00Z",

 "topic": "Reducing household plastic waste"

}

```



Example API Response:

```json

{

 "consultation_id": "c-345678",

 "status": "scheduled",

 "join_url": "https://video.ecolaura.com/c-345678",

 "expert": {

  "name": "Dr. Green",

  "specialty": "Waste Reduction"

 },

 "scheduled_time": "2023-09-15T14:30:00Z"

}

```



## 🌿 User Flow



1. User requests a consultation from product page or dashboard

2. System suggests available time slots and matching experts

3. User selects a slot and confirms booking

4. Both user and expert receive confirmation and calendar invite

5. At the scheduled time, both parties click the join link

6. Video consultation session begins

7. Post-session, user can rate the experience and receive a summary



## 🔒 Security and Privacy Considerations



1. **End-to-End Encryption**: All video streams are encrypted using WebRTC's built-in encryption.

2. **Secure Signaling**: Use of HTTPS for all signaling traffic.

3. **Access Control**: Unique, one-time-use links for joining consultations.

4. **Data Protection**: Minimal data storage, with recordings (if any) securely encrypted.

5. **Consent Management**: Clear opt-in for recordings and data usage.



## 🚀 Performance Optimization



1. **Adaptive Bitrate**: Dynamically adjust video quality based on network conditions.

2. **Efficient Codec Usage**: Utilize VP8/VP9 for video and Opus for audio.

3. **Turn Servers**: Deploy TURN servers globally to ensure connectivity.

4. **Preconnect and Prefetch**: Optimize page load times for consultation rooms.



Example of adaptive bitrate implementation:



```javascript

const constraints = {

 video: {

  width: { ideal: 1280 },

  height: { ideal: 720 },

  frameRate: { ideal: 24 }

 }

}



navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints)

 .then(stream => {

  const videoTrack = stream.getVideoTracks()[0]

  const capabilities = videoTrack.getCapabilities()



  // Function to adjust quality based on network conditions

  const adjustQuality = (speed) => {

   if (speed < 1000) { // Speed in kbps

    videoTrack.applyConstraints({ width: 640, height: 480, frameRate: 15 })

   } else if (speed < 2000) {

    videoTrack.applyConstraints({ width: 960, height: 540, frameRate: 20 })

   } else {

    videoTrack.applyConstraints({ width: 1280, height: 720, frameRate: 24 })

   }

  }



  // Monitor network conditions and adjust (simplified)

  setInterval(() => {

   const speed = getCurrentNetworkSpeed() // Implement this function

   adjustQuality(speed)

  }, 5000)

 })

```



## 🔗 Integration with Other Services



- **AI Consultant**: Provides pre-consultation briefs and post-consultation summaries.

- **User Profile**: Accesses user preferences and history for personalized consultations.

- **Product Catalog**: Allows easy reference to specific products during consultations.

- **Sustainability Calculator**: Provides real-time sustainability metrics for discussion.



## 🧪 Testing and Quality Assurance



1. **Automated Testing**: Unit and integration tests for booking and signaling systems.

2. **Manual Testing**: Regular test calls to ensure video/audio quality.

3. **Load Testing**: Simulate multiple concurrent sessions to ensure scalability.

4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Beta testing with a group of eco-conscious users.

5. **Expert Feedback**: Regular check-ins with sustainability experts for improvement suggestions.



Example Test Case (Jest):



```javascript

describe('Video Consultation Booking', () => {

 test('successfully schedules a consultation', async () => {

  const userData = {

   userId: 'u-123456',

   expertId: 'e-789012',

   scheduledTime: '2023-09-15T14:30:00Z',

   topic: 'Reducing household plastic waste'

  }



  const response = await api.post('/api/v1/consultations', userData)



  expect(response.status).toBe(200)

  expect(response.data).toHaveProperty('consultation_id')

  expect(response.data.status).toBe('scheduled')

  expect(response.data).toHaveProperty('join_url')

 })

})

```



## 🌱 Future Growth
