## 🛠️ Technical Implementation



The Sustainability Calculator uses a multi-factor algorithm considering various environmental aspects:



```python

import numpy as np



class SustainabilityCalculator:

  def __init__(self):

    self.factor_weights = {

      'materials': 0.3,

      'production': 0.25,

      'transportation': 0.2,

      'usage': 0.15,

      'end_of_life': 0.1

    }

  def calculate_product_score(self, product_data):

    scores = {}

    for factor, weight in self.factor_weights.items():

      scores[factor] = self._calculate_factor_score(product_data[factor]) * weight

    total_score = sum(scores.values())

    return round(total_score * 100) # Scale to 0-100

  def _calculate_factor_score(self, factor_data):

    # Complex calculation based on factor-specific criteria

    # Returns a score between 0 and 1

    pass



  def calculate_carbon_footprint(self, produc_data):

    # Estimate carbon footprint in kg CO2e

    materials_footprint = self._calculate_materials_footprint(product_data['materials'])

    production_footprint = self._calculate_production_footprint(product_data['production'])

    transport_footprint = self._calculate_transport_footprint(product_data['transportation'])

    total_footprint = materials_footprint + production_footprint + transport_footprint

    return round(total_footprint, 2)



  def _calculate_materials_footprint(self, materials_data):

    # Calculate carbon footprint of materials

    pass



  def _calculate_production_footprint(self, production_data):

    # Calculate carbon footprint of production process

    pass



  def _calculate_transport_footprint(self, transport_data):

    # Calculate carbon footprint of transportation

    pass

```



## 🌐 API Endpoints



The Sustainability Calculator service exposes RESTful API endpoints:

2. `POST /api/v1/sustainability/compare`: Compare sustainability of multiple products

3. `POST /api/v1/sustainability/user-impact`: Calculate user's environmental impact

4. `GET /api/v1/sustainability/carbon-footprint/{product_id}`: Get carbon footprint of a product



Example API Request:

```http

GET /api/v1/sustainability/product/ECO-WB-001

```



Example API Response:

```json

{

 "product_id": "ECO-WB-001",

 "sustainability_score": 85,

 "breakdown": {

  "materials": 90,

  "production": 80,

  "transportation": 75,

  "usage": 95,

  "end_of_life": 85

 },

```



## 🧮 Calculation Methodology



Our sustainability calculations consider multiple factors:



1. **Materials**: Sourcing, renewability, and toxicity of materials

2. **Production**: Energy efficiency, waste management, and water usage in manufacturing

3. **Transportation**: Distance traveled, mode of transport, and packaging efficiency

4. **Usage**: Energy consumption, durability, and maintenance requirements

5. **End-of-Life**: Recyclability, biodegradability, and disposal impact



Each factor is weighted based on its relative importance and industry standards.



## 📊 Data Inputs and Outputs



Inputs:

- Product specifications (materials, weight, dimensions)

- Manufacturing data (energy usage, waste produced)

- Transportation details (distance, mode of transport)

- Usage patterns (energy consumption, lifespan)

- End-of-life characteristics (recyclable components, disposal methods)



Outputs:

- Overall sustainability score (0-100)

- Breakdown of scores by factor

- Carbon footprint estimation (in kg CO2e)

- Comparative sustainability metrics



## 🎯 Accuracy and Limitations



- Accuracy: Our calculations are based on the latest scientific research and industry data

- Margin of Error: Typically within ±5% for sustainability scores, ±10% for carbon footprint

- Limitations: 

 - Dependence on accurate input data

 - Simplification of complex environmental processes

 - Regional variations in environmental impact



## 🔗 Integration with Other Services



- **Blockchain Tracker**: Verifies the authenticity of sustainability data inputs

- **AI Consultant**: Uses sustainability scores for personalized recommendations

- **Product Catalog**: Automatically updates product listings with sustainability information

- **User Dashboard**: Displays personal environmental impact based on purchases and actions



## 🧪 Testing and Validation Strategies



1. **Unit Testing**: Verify individual calculation functions

2. **Integration Testing**: Ensure correct data flow between services

3. **Scenario Testing**: Run calculations on diverse product types and user behaviors

4. **Comparison Testing**: Cross-check results with established sustainability databases

5. **Expert Review**: Periodic review of methodology by environmental scientists



Example Test Case (Python with pytest):



```python

import pytest

from sustainability_calculator import SustainabilityCalculator



def test_product_score_calculation():

  calculator = SustainabilityCalculator()

  product_data = {

    'materials': {'type': 'recycled_plastic', 'weight': 0.5},

    'production': {'energy_usage': 'low', 'waste_produced': 'minimal'},

    'transportation': {'distance': 100, 'mode': 'electric_vehicle'},

    'usage': {'energy_consumption': 'none', 'lifespan': 5},

    'end_of_life': {'recyclable': True, 'biodegradable': False}

  }

  score = calculator.calculate_product_score(product_data)

  assert 80 <= score <= 95, f"Score {score} outside expected range for eco-friendly product"



def test_carbon_footprint_calculation():

  calculator = SustainabilityCalculator()

  product_data = {

    'materials': {'type': 'virgin_plastic', 'weight': 1},

    'production': {'energy_usage': 'medium', 'waste_produced': 'moderate'},

    'transportation': {'distance': 1000, 'mode': 'truck'}

  }

  footprint = calculator.calculate_carbon_footprint(product_data)

  assert 5 <= footprint <= 15, f"Carbon footprint {footprint} outside expected range"

```



## 🌱 Future Enhancements



As our Sustainability Calculator evolves, we plan to:

1. Incorporate real-time data from IoT devices in manufacturing and logistics

2. Develop more granular regional impact assessments

3. Implement machine learning for improved accuracy and predictive modeling
