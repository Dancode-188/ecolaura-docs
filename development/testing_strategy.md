# 🧪 Ecolaura Testing Strategy: Cultivating Reliable Code



Welcome to Ecolaura's Testing Strategy documentation! Just as we carefully verify the sustainability of our products, we rigorously test our code to ensure a robust and reliable platform. Let's explore how we nurture a healthy codebase through comprehensive testing! 🌱💻



## 🎯 Overview



Our testing strategy aims to:

1. Ensure functionality meets specifications

2. Maintain high code quality

3. Prevent regressions

4. Improve system reliability

5. Facilitate rapid, confident development



## 🧩 Types of Tests



We employ a diverse ecosystem of tests:



### 1. 🔬 Unit Tests

- Test individual functions or methods

- Fast execution, run frequently

- Use for core business logic and utility functions



### 2. 🔗 Integration Tests

- Test interactions between components

- Verify correct API behavior

- Ensure database operations work as expected



### 3. 🌐 End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- Simulate real user scenarios

- Test complete user flows

- Catch issues that unit and integration tests might miss



### 4. 🏋️ Performance Tests

- Evaluate system behavior under load

- Identify bottlenecks

- Ensure scalability



### 5. 🔒 Security Tests

- Identify vulnerabilities

- Verify proper authentication and authorization

- Protect against common attack vectors



## 🛠️ Tools and Frameworks



We use the following tools to cultivate our test suite:



- **Unit & Integration Testing**: 

 - Backend: pytest

 - Frontend: Jest

- **E2E Testing**: Cypress

- **Performance Testing**: k6

- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP

- **Code Coverage**: Coverage.py (Backend), Istanbul (Frontend)

- **Mocking**: unittest.mock (Python), Jest (JavaScript)



## 💡 Best Practices



1. **Follow AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert

2. **Keep Tests Isolated**: Each test should be independent

3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Test names should describe the scenario and expected outcome

4. **Don't Test External Code**: Focus on your own logic

5. **Aim for High Coverage**: But prioritize critical paths over 100% coverage

6. **Maintain Test Data**: Use factories or fixtures for consistent test data



Example of a well-structured test:



```python

def test_calculate_sustainability_score_returns_expected_value():

  # Arrange

  product = Product(

    materials=["recycled plastic"],

    production_process="solar powered",

    packaging="biodegradable"

  )

  expected_score = 85



  # Act

  actual_score = calculate_sustainability_score(product)



  # Assert

  assert actual_score == expected_score, f"Expected score of {expected_score}, but got {actual_score}"

```



## 📊 Code Coverage



We strive for high code coverage to ensure comprehensive testing:



- Minimum required coverage: 80%

- Aim for 100% coverage on critical paths

- Exclude third-party code and boilerplate from coverage metrics



To run coverage reports:



Backend:

```bash

pytest --cov=ecolaura --cov-report=html

```



Frontend:

```bash

npm test -- --coverage

```



## 🌱 Test-Driven Development (TDD)



We encourage TDD for complex features:



1. Write a failing test

2. Implement the minimum code to pass the test

3. Refactor while keeping the test passing

4. Repeat



This approach leads to more maintainable and well-designed code.



## 🚀 Performance and Load Testing



We use k6 for performance testing:



```javascript

import http from 'k6/http';

import { check, sleep } from 'k6';



export const options = {

 vus: 100,

 duration: '30s',

};



export default function () {

 const res = http.get('https://api.ecolaura.com/v1/products');

 check(res, { 'status was 200': (r) => r.status == 200 });

 sleep(1);

}

```



Run performance tests regularly and before major releases.



## 🎭 Mocking and Stubbing



Use mocks to isolate units of code:



```python

from unittest.mock import patch



def test_get_product_sustainability_score():

  with patch('ecolaura.services.sustainability.calculate_score') as mock_calculate:

    mock_calculate.return_value = 85

    product = Product(id='123')

    score = get_product_sustainability_score(product)

    assert score == 85

    mock_calculate.assert_called_once_with(product)

```



## 🔄 Continuous Integration



Our CI pipeline automatically runs tests on every push:



1. Linting

2. Unit Tests

3. Integration Tests

4. E2E Tests (on staging environment)

5. Performance Tests (nightly)



## 🌿 Testing Ecolaura-Specific Features



### Sustainability Score Calculation

- Unit test each component of the calculation

- Integration test the full calculation process

- E2E test the display of scores in the UI



### Trade-In Program

- Mock external shipping APIs for unit tests

- Integration test the credit calculation process

- E2E test the full trade-in user journey



## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Test Issues



- **Flaky Tests**: Identify and fix tests that intermittently fail

- **Slow Tests**: Optimize or move slow tests to a separate suite

- **Dependencies**: Use dependency injection to make tests more isolated



## 🌱 Continuous Improvement



We regularly review and improve our testing strategy:



1. Analyze test results and coverage reports

2. Refactor tests for better readability and maintainability

3. Stay updated on new testing tools and methodologies

4. Conduct testing workshops to share knowledge



## 🤝 Contributing



Think you can help make our testing even more robust? We're all ears! Here's how you can contribute:



1. **New Test Cases**: Suggest scenarios we might have missed

2. **Tool Recommendations**: Propose new testing tools or frameworks

3. **Performance Improvements**: Help optimize our test suite execution time



Remember, thorough testing is the foundation of a reliable, sustainable codebase. Let's work together to keep Ecolaura bug-free and blooming! 🌿🧪🚀
