# 🚀 Ecolaura CI/CD Pipeline: Cultivating Sustainable Code



Welcome to Ecolaura's CI/CD Pipeline documentation! Just as we nurture sustainable products, we cultivate sustainable code through continuous integration and deployment. Let's explore how we keep our codebase as green as our mission! 🌱💻



## 🎯 Overview



Our CI/CD pipeline ensures that every change to Ecolaura's codebase is automatically built, tested, and deployed with the reliability of a well-tended garden. We use GitHub Actions for our pipeline, embracing the power of automation to maintain our digital ecosystem.



## 🛠️ Tools We Use



- **Version Control**: GitHub

- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions

- **Containerization**: Docker

- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes

- **Cloud Platform**: AWS (Amazon Web Services)



## 🌿 CI/CD Workflow



Our pipeline is like a carefully planned permaculture system, where each stage nurtures the next:



1. **Code Commit** 🌱

2. **Build** 🏗️

3. **Test** 🧪

4. **Analyze** 🔍

5. **Stage** 🎭

6. **Production Deploy** 🚀



Let's dive into each stage!



### 1. Code Commit 🌱



When a developer pushes code or opens a pull request:

- GitHub Actions is triggered

- The pipeline begins its journey



### 2. Build 🏗️



```yaml

jobs:

 build:

  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  steps:

   - uses: actions/checkout@v2

   - name: Set up Python

    uses: actions/setup-python@v2

    with:

     python-version: '3.8'

   - name: Install dependencies

    run: |

     python -m pip install --upgrade pip

     pip install -r requirements.txt

   - name: Build

    run: python setup.py build

```



### 3. Test 🧪



```yaml

 test:

  needs: build

  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  steps:

   - uses: actions/checkout@v2

   - name: Run tests

    run: python -m pytest tests/

   - name: Run integration tests

    run: python -m pytest integration_tests/

```



### 4. Analyze 🔍



```yaml

 analyze:

  needs: test

  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  steps:

   - uses: actions/checkout@v2

   - name: Run linter

    run: pylint **/*.py

   - name: Check code coverage

    run: coverage run -m pytest

   - name: Upload coverage report

    uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1

```



### 5. Stage 🎭



```yaml

 stage:

  needs: analyze

  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  steps:

   - uses: actions/checkout@v2

   - name: Configure AWS credentials

    uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1

    with:

     aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}

     aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

   - name: Deploy to staging

    run: |

     docker build -t ecolaura-app .

     docker push our-ecr-repo/ecolaura-app:staging

     kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/

```



### 6. Production Deploy 🚀


```yaml

 deploy:

  needs: stage

  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

  steps:

   - uses: actions/checkout@v2

   - name: Configure AWS credentials

    uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1

    with:

     aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}

     aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

   - name: Deploy to production

    run: |

     docker build -t ecolaura-app .

     docker push our-ecr-repo/ecolaura-app:latest

     kubectl apply -f k8s/production/

```



## 🌍 Environment Configurations



We maintain separate configurations for different environments, like different climate zones in a global garden:



- **Development**: Local environment for developers

- **Staging**: Mimics production for final testing

- **Production**: The live environment serving our users



Environment-specific variables are stored in AWS Parameter Store and injected into our Kubernetes deployments.



## 🔒 Security Considerations



Security in our pipeline is like organic pest control - essential and non-toxic:



1. **Secrets Management**: We use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information.

2. **Least Privilege**: Our IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege.

3. **Image Scanning**: We scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before deployment.

4. **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**: Integrated into our analyze stage.



## 💡 Best Practices for Developers



1. **Branch Protection**: Main branch is protected. All changes must go through pull requests.

2. **Conventional Commits**: Use conventional commit messages to auto-generate changelogs.

3. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for easier rollbacks and A/B testing.

4. **Automated Testing**: Write and maintain comprehensive unit and integration tests.

5. **Monitor Builds**: Keep an eye on pipeline status and address failures promptly.



## 🐛 Troubleshooting



- **Build Failures**: Check logs in GitHub Actions for specific error messages.

- **Deployment Issues**: Verify Kubernetes configurations and check AWS EKS logs.

- **Test Failures**: Run tests locally to debug before pushing changes.



## 🌱 Future Enhancements



We're always looking to make our pipeline greener and more efficient:



1. **Canary Deployments**: Gradually roll out changes to a subset of users.

2. **Automated Rollbacks**: Implement automatic rollbacks for failed deployments.

3. **Performance Testing**: Integrate automated performance testing into our pipeline.

4. **AI-Powered Code Review**: Implement AI tools to assist in code reviews.
