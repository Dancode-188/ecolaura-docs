# 🌳 Ecolaura API Versioning: Nurturing Sustainable Growth



Welcome to Ecolaura's API Versioning documentation! Just as ecosystems evolve over time, our API grows and adapts. This guide explains how we manage this evolution while maintaining a stable environment for our API consumers. Let's explore how we cultivate a thriving, backward-compatible API ecosystem! 🌿🔢



## 🎯 Overview



Ecolaura's API versioning strategy aims to:

1. Ensure backward compatibility for existing integrations

2. Allow for innovation and improvement of our API

3. Provide a clear upgrade path for API consumers

4. Maintain a balance between stability and evolution



## 🌿 Versioning Strategy



We use URL-based versioning for our API. This approach offers clarity and simplicity for our users.



### URL Structure



```

https://api.ecolaura.com/v{version_number}/{resource}

```



Example:

```

https://api.ecolaura.com/v1/products

https://api.ecolaura.com/v2/sustainability-score

```



### Version Numbers



We use whole numbers for our API versions (v1, v2, v3, etc.). This simplifies communication and avoids confusion with minor updates.



## 🔢 Accessing Different Versions



To access a specific version of the API, include the version number in the URL:



```python

import requests



# Accessing v1 of the API

response = requests.get('https://api.ecolaura.com/v1/products')



# Accessing v2 of the API

response = requests.get('https://api.ecolaura.com/v2/products')

```



## 🔄 API Lifecycle



Each API version goes through the following stages:



1. **Active**: Fully supported and recommended for use

2. **Deprecated**: Still functional but no longer recommended; users are encouraged to migrate

3. **Sunset**: No longer supported or accessible



### Support Periods



- We guarantee support for each major version for a minimum of 18 months after its release.

- Deprecated versions will be supported for at least 6 months after deprecation notice.



## 🌱 Version Migration



When a new version is released:



1. We provide detailed migration guides in our documentation.

2. We offer a transition period where both old and new versions are supported.

3. We may provide migration scripts or tools for complex changes.



Example migration guide snippet:



```markdown

## Migrating from v1 to v2



### Changes in the Product Endpoint



In v2, the `sustainability_score` field has been moved to its own endpoint:



v1:

GET /v1/products/{id}

{

 "id": "123",

 "name": "Eco Water Bottle",

 "sustainability_score": 95

}



v2:

GET /v2/products/{id}

{

 "id": "123",

 "name": "Eco Water Bottle"

}



GET /v2/sustainability-score/{product_id}

{

 "product_id": "123",

 "score": 95,

 "breakdown": {

  "materials": 90,

  "manufacturing": 95,

  "packaging": 100

 }

}

```



## 🌳 Breaking vs. Non-Breaking Changes



### Breaking Changes



Breaking changes are introduced in new major versions and may include:

- Removing or renaming fields

- Changing data types

- Altering request/response structures



### Non-Breaking Changes



Non-breaking changes can be introduced in the current version:

- Adding new endpoints

- Adding new optional request parameters

- Adding new fields to responses



## 📢 Communication Strategy



We keep our API consumers informed through multiple channels:



1. **Change Log**: Detailed list of changes for each version

2. **Email Notifications**: Subscribers receive updates about new versions and deprecations

3. **API Dashboard**: Real-time notifications and version status

4. **Developer Blog**: In-depth articles about significant changes and best practices



Example change log entry:



```markdown

## v2.0.0 (2023-08-15)



### Breaking Changes

- Moved `sustainability_score` from Product to its own endpoint

- Changed authentication from API key to OAuth 2.0



### New Features

- Added detailed breakdown for sustainability scores

- Introduced new endpoint for carbon footprint calculation



### Improvements

- Improved response time for product listing endpoint

- Enhanced error messages for better debugging

```



## 💡 Best Practices for API Consumers



1. Always specify the API version in your requests

2. Regularly check our change log and notifications

3. Test your integration against new versions in our sandbox environment

4. Plan for migrations well before deprecation dates

5. Use our client libraries which handle versioning automatically



## 🔮 Future API Evolution



We're committed to evolving our API to better serve our eco-conscious community:



1. Exploring GraphQL for more flexible data querying

2. Considering semantic versioning for more granular updates

3. Investigating API gateway solutions for enhanced management and analytics



## 🐛 Troubleshooting Version-Related Issues



1. **Unexpected Responses**: Verify you're using the intended API version

2. **Deprecated Feature Warnings**: Check the change log and plan for migration

3. **Version Mismatch Errors**: Ensure all endpoints in your integration use the same version



## 🤝 Contributing to API Evolution



We value input from our API consumers:



1. **Feature Requests**: Suggest new endpoints or improvements

2. **Beta Testing**: Participate in beta programs for new API versions

3. **Migration Feedback**: Share your experience with version migrations



Remember, a well-versioned API is like a carefully tended garden, allowing for growth and change while providing a stable environment for its inhabitants. Let's grow this eco-friendly API together! 🌱🔢🌍
