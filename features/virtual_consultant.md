4. Response is formatted and returned to the user

2. Consultant greets user and asks about their eco-friendly goals

3. User asks questions or seeks advice

4. Consultant provides information, product recommendations, or eco-tips

5. User can ask follow-up questions or start a new topic

6. Chat history is saved for future reference (with user permission)

## 💡 Best Practices



1. **Context Awareness**: Always consider the conversation history when implementing responses.

2. **Personality Consistency**: Maintain a friendly, encouraging tone that aligns with Ecolaura's brand.

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Have graceful fallbacks for queries the AI can't confidently answer.

4. **User Feedback Loop**: Implement a way for users to rate the helpfulness of responses.

5. **Privacy First**: Be transparent about data usage and allow users to opt out of data collection.



## 🔧 Implementation Tips



Here's a simplified Python pseudo-code for processing a user message:



```python

from ecolaura.nlp import process_message

from ecolaura.ml import generate_response

from ecolaura.products import get_relevant_products



def handle_user_message(message, conversation_id):

  # Process the message

  intent, entities = process_message(message)

  # Get relevant product information

  products = get_relevant_products(intent, entities)

  # Generate response

  response = generate_response(intent, entities, products)

  # Save to conversation history

  save_to_history(conversation_id, message, response)

  return response

```
