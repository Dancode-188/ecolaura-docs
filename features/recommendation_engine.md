# 🌟 Ecolaura Recommendation Engine: Cultivating Sustainable Choices



Welcome to Ecolaura's Recommendation Engine documentation! This feature is our digital gardener, nurturing users' sustainable shopping journeys by suggesting eco-friendly products tailored to their preferences and needs. Let's explore how we're growing a forest of personalized, planet-friendly recommendations! 🌿🛒



## 🎯 Overview



Ecolaura's recommendation engine aims to:

1. Enhance user experience by suggesting relevant, sustainable products

2. Increase engagement with our eco-friendly product catalog

3. Educate users about sustainable alternatives

4. Boost sales while promoting environmentally responsible choices

5. Personalize the shopping experience based on individual sustainability goals



## 🧩 Types of Recommendations



### 1. 🌱 Sustainability-Focused Recommendations

Suggests products with high sustainability scores that align with the user's eco-goals.



### 2. 👥 Collaborative Filtering

Recommends products based on similar users' preferences and behaviors.



### 3. 📊 Content-Based Filtering

Suggests products similar to those the user has shown interest in or purchased.



### 4. 🔄 Hybrid Approach

Combines multiple recommendation types for more accurate and diverse suggestions.



## 🧠 Algorithms and Techniques



### Sustainability-Focused Recommendations

```python

def get_sustainability_recommendations(user_id, product_id=None):

  user_preferences = get_user_preferences(user_id)

  if product_id:

    base_product = get_product(product_id)

    similar_products = find_similar_sustainable_products(base_product)

  else:

    similar_products = find_top_sustainable_products(user_preferences)

  return rank_recommendations(similar_products, user_preferences)



def find_similar_sustainable_products(base_product):

  return Product.objects.filter(

    category=base_product.category,

    sustainability_score__gte=base_product.sustainability_score

  ).exclude(id=base_product.id).order_by('-sustainability_score')[:10]



def rank_recommendations(products, user_preferences):

  return sorted(

    products,

    key=lambda p: (

      p.sustainability_score,

      calculate_preference_match(p, user_preferences)

    ),

    reverse=True

  )

```



### Collaborative Filtering

We use a matrix factorization approach, implemented with the Surprise library:



```python

from surprise import SVD, Dataset



def train_collaborative_model(ratings_data):

  data = Dataset.load_from_df(ratings_data, Reader())

  trainset = data.build_full_trainset()

  model = SVD(n_factors=100, n_epochs=20, lr_all=0.005, reg_all=0.02)

  model.fit(trainset)

  return model



def get_collaborative_recommendations(user_id, model):

  user_products = get_user_rated_products(user_id)

  all_products = get_all_products()

  unrated_products = set(all_products) - set(user_products)

  predictions = [model.predict(user_id, product_id) for product_id in unrated_products]

  return sorted(predictions, key=lambda x: x.est, reverse=True)[:10]

```



## 📊 Data Sources



Our recommendation engine feeds on a rich compost of data:



1. User behavior (views, purchases, ratings)

2. Product attributes (category, price, sustainability score)

3. User profiles (preferences, sustainability goals)

4. Global trends in eco-friendly products



## 🔗 Integration with Other Features



- **Product Catalog**: Sources product data and sustainability scores

- **User Profiles**: Retrieves user preferences and behavior

- **Sustainability Scores**: Factors into recommendation rankings

```



## 🎨 Personalization Strategies



1. **Sustainability Goals**: Tailor recommendations based on user's eco-objectives

2. **Purchase History**: Suggest complementary products to past purchases

3. **Browsing Behavior**: Recommend based on recently viewed or searched items

4. **Seasonality**: Adjust recommendations based on current season and local climate

5. **User Feedback**: Continuously learn from user interactions and ratings



## 🚀 Performance Optimization



1. **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequently recommended products

2. **Batch Processing**: Pre-compute recommendations during off-peak hours

3. **Indexing**: Optimize database queries with appropriate indexes

4. **Asynchronous Updates**: Update user profiles and product data asynchronously



## 🔮 Future Enhancements



We're always cultivating new ideas for our recommendation engine:



1. **AI-Powered Image Recognition**: Recommend products based on user-uploaded images

2. **Voice-Activated Recommendations**: Integrate with smart home devices for verbal suggestions

3. **Augmented Reality**: Provide recommendations based on user's physical environment
