# 🔐 Ecolaura User Authentication: Safeguarding Our Digital Forest



Welcome to Ecolaura's User Authentication documentation! Just as a forest has natural defenses to protect its inhabitants, our authentication system serves as a robust barrier to safeguard our users and their data. Let's explore how we cultivate trust and security in our digital ecosystem! 🌿🛡️



## 🌍 Overview



Our authentication system ensures that:

- Users can securely create and access their accounts

- User data remains private and protected

- We maintain a secure and trustworthy platform for sustainable e-commerce



## 🌱 Registration Process



New users can join our ecosystem through a simple, secure registration process:



1. User provides email, password, and optional details

2. System validates input and checks for existing accounts

3. Password is securely hashed

4. Confirmation email is sent to verify the email address

5. User account is created upon email verification



Example registration endpoint:



```python

@app.route('/api/register', methods=['POST'])

def register():

  data = request.get_json()

  if User.query.filter_by(email=data['email']).first():

    return jsonify({'message': 'Email already registered'}), 400

  hashed_password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(data['password']).decode('utf-8')

  new_user = User(email=data['email'], password=hashed_password)

  db.session.add(new_user)

  db.session.commit()

  send_confirmation_email(new_user.email)

  return jsonify({'message': 'User registered. Please confirm your email.'}), 201

```



## 🔑 Login and Logout



Our login process uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, stateless authentication:



1. User submits email and password

2. System verifies credentials

3. If valid, a JWT is generated and returned

4. Client stores the JWT and includes it in subsequent requests



Logout is handled by the client, which removes the stored JWT.



Example login endpoint:



```python

@app.route('/api/login', methods=['POST'])

def login():

  data = request.get_json()

  user = User.query.filter_by(email=data['email']).first()

  if user and bcrypt.check_password_hash(user.password, data['password']):

    token = create_access_token(identity=user.id)

    return jsonify({'token': token}), 200

  return jsonify({'message': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401

```



## 🔄 Password Reset



Users can reset their password through a secure process:



1. User requests password reset

2. System sends a time-limited reset token via email

3. User clicks the reset link and enters a new password

4. System verifies the token and updates the password



## 🛡️ Security Measures



We implement various security measures to protect user accounts:



- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt

- JWTs are signed and have a short expiration time

- Rate limiting is applied to prevent brute-force attacks

- HTTPS is used for all communications



Example of password hashing:



```python

from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt



bcrypt = Bcrypt()



def hash_password(password):

  return bcrypt.generate_password_hash(password).decode('utf-8')



def check_password(hashed_password, password):

  return bcrypt.check_password_hash(hashed_password, password)

```



## 🌐 Social Login



We offer social login options to simplify the authentication process:



- Google Sign-In

- Facebook Login



These are implemented using OAuth 2.0 protocol.



## 📱 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)



For enhanced security, users can enable 2FA:



1. User activates 2FA in account settings

2. System generates a secret key and QR code

3. User adds the key to their authenticator app

4. On login, user must provide the 2FA code along with their password



## ⏳ Session Management



While we use JWTs for stateless authentication, we implement the following for session management:



- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)

- Longer-lived refresh tokens (7 days)

- Refresh tokens are rotated on each use



Example refresh token endpoint:



```python

@app.route('/api/token/refresh', methods=['POST'])

@jwt_required(refresh=True)

def refresh():

  identity = get_jwt_identity()

  new_token = create_access_token(identity=identity)

  return jsonify({'token': new_token}), 200

```



## 🌿 API Endpoints



Key authentication-related endpoints:



- POST /api/register: Create a new user account

- POST /api/login: Authenticate user and receive JWT

- POST /api/logout: Client-side logout (no server endpoint needed)

- POST /api/password/reset-request: Request a password reset

- POST /api/password/reset: Reset password with token

- POST /api/token/refresh: Get a new access token



## ✅ Best Practices for Developers



1. Never store passwords in plain text

2. Use HTTPS for all authentication-related requests

3. Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive information

4. Use secure random number generators for tokens

5. Keep authentication logic server-side

6. Regularly audit and update the authentication system



## 🌱 Growing Our Authentication System



As our digital forest grows, we continually enhance our authentication:



- Exploring passwordless authentication options

- Implementing risk-based authentication

- Enhancing our fraud detection capabilities



By nurturing a robust authentication system, we ensure that our users can safely explore and engage with our sustainable e-commerce platform. Together, we're cultivating a secure digital environment for eco-conscious growth! 🌿🔒🌍
